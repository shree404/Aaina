            Purchase Conditions The following are the standard sales conditions
            for consumer purchases of goods made over the internet. The purchase
            is governed by these conditions, and consumer purchases are mainly
            regulated by several acts such as the <br />
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>Contracts Act,</li> <br />
              <li> The Consumer Purchases Act,</li> <br />
              <li> The Marketing Act,</li> <br />
              <li>The Right of Cancellation Act, and</li> <br />
              <li> The E-commerce Act.</li> <br />
              <br />
            </ul>
            These laws provide the consumer with inalienable rights, and the
            terms of this agreement should not be viewed as limiting these
            statutory rights. Instead, they outline the most significant rights
            and obligations for the trade. The ordering solution's information,
            the sales conditions, and any individually agreed-upon terms are all
            included in the agreement. In the event of a discrepancy between
            such information, the individually agreed-upon terms shall control,
            provided that such terms do not conflict with applicable law. The
            agreement will be supplemented by any applicable legislative clauses
            that govern the exchange of commodities between businesses and
            consumers. <br />
            <br />
            Parties: The parties to the agreement are the buyer, who is the
            customer placing the order, and the seller, Aina,
            with addresses at Bardaghat Nepal and organization
            number 986-7481767. <br />
            <br />
            VAT is included in every price displayed in the online store. The
            buyer must pay the full amount, which includes all taxes and
            additional expenses, as mentioned in the pricing for the goods and
            services. The buyer is not liable for any additional expenses that
            the seller did not disclose to them before the sale. The seller
            maintains the right to adjust prices, deal with colour discrepancies
            and sold-out items, and fix typographical errors. When the customer
            sends the order to the seller, the agreement is legally binding for
            both parties. If there is an error in the buyer's order, the
            seller's offer, or the ordering system in the online store, and the
            other party knew or should have known that there was an error, the
            agreement is not binding. <br /> <br />
            From the moment the goods are sent to the customer, the seller has
            the right to request payment. If the buyer pays using a credit or
            debit card, the vendor will put the whole purchase price on the card
            when the order is placed. On the day the item is sent, the card is
            charged. <br />
            <br />
            When the buyer or their agent takes possession of the item, the
            delivery has occurred. The seller must deliver the items to the
            buyer without undue delay and no later than 30 days following the
            customer's order if there is no delivery deadline indicated in the
            order solution. Unless the parties otherwise agree, the products
            must be delivered to the customer. Reservations and orders are not
            delivered to Svalbard. When the buyer or their representative
            receives the items, the risk of the goods shifts to them. The buyer
            can cancel the purchase within 14 days of receiving the item by
            notifying the seller of the use of the right of withdrawal. The
            buyer has the burden of proof that the right of withdrawal has been
            exercised, and the notification should be made in writing (right of
            the withdrawal form, e-mail, or letter). The goods must be returned
            to the seller without undue delay and no later than 14 days from the
            notification of the use of the right of withdrawal. The buyer is
            responsible for the direct costs of returning the item unless
            otherwise agreed upon or the seller has failed to state that the
            buyer must cover the return costs. The seller cannot charge a fee
            for the buyer's use of the right of withdrawal. The buyer may
            examine or test the goods reasonably and necessarily to determine
            their nature, properties, and function, without losing the right of
            withdrawal. If the examination or testing goes beyond what is
            reasonable and necessary, the buyer may be held liable for any
            reduced value of the goods. Without undue delay and within 14 days
            of obtaining notice that the buyer intends to exercise their right
            to cancel, the seller is required to reimburse the customer for the
            purchase amount. The seller has the right to withhold payment until
            either the buyer provides proof that the items have been returned or
            the seller receives the goods from the buyer. <br />
            <br />
            The buyer has rights under Chapter 5 of the Consumer Buying Act if
            the seller fails to deliver the products or delivers them after the
            scheduled time and it was not the customer's fault. These options
            include delaying payment, requesting delivery of the items,
            terminating the contract, and requesting financial compensation from
            the supplier. To have written proof of their claim, the buyer should
            submit any claims for default powers in writing, such as by email.
            The buyer has the right to stand by the deal and ask the seller to
            carry out their end of the bargain. Nevertheless, the buyer cannot
            insist on fulfilment if there is an insurmountable hurdle that the
            seller is unable to overcome, or if the expense or inconvenience to
            the seller to fulfil is disproportionately great compared to the
            buyer's interest in the fulfilment. Nonetheless, the buyer may still
            ask for fulfilment if the obstruction is removed within a reasonable
            amount of time. If the buyer unnecessarily postpones making the
            claim, they lose their right to demand fulfilment. <br />
            <br /> The buyer should ask the vendor to deliver the items within a
            reasonable extension of time if the seller doesn't deliver at the
            scheduled time. The buyer may cancel the order if the supplier does
            not deliver the products by the extended deadline. Nonetheless, the
            buyer has the right to cancel the order right away if the vendor
            declines to deliver the item. The same holds if delivery at the
            appointed time was necessary for the agreement to be finalized or if
            the buyer has already informed the seller that the delivery time is
            important. Buyer must submit a claim for cancellation within a
            reasonable amount of time if the items are delivered after the
            buyer-imposed extension date or after the delivery window required
            by the agreement. Unless the seller can demonstrate that the delay
            was brought on by an unforeseen barrier beyond their control that
            they were unable to avoid or alleviate, the buyer has the right to
            seek compensation for small losses brought on by the delay. <br />
            <br />
            Defects in goods: If a product has a defect, the buyer should inform
            the seller within a reasonable time after discovering the defect or
            when it should have been discovered. If the buyer informs the seller
            within two months of discovering the defect, it is considered
            timely. Complaints can be made within two years of taking over the
            item, or five years if the product is intended to last significantly
            longer. If the defect is not due to the buyer or circumstances on
            their side, the buyer can withhold the purchase price, demand
            rectification or redelivery, ask for a price reduction, demand the
            contract be terminated, and/or ask for compensation from the seller,
            according to Chapter 6 of the Consumer Purchase Act. Complaints
            should be made in writing. The buyer can choose between
            rectification and redelivery of equivalent items. However, if it is
            impossible or too costly for the seller, they can object. The seller
            must make the correction or redelivery within a reasonable time and
            cannot make more than two remedial attempts for the same defect. If
            the item is not corrected or redelivered, the buyer can demand a
            suitable price discount. The price reduction should correspond to
            the ratio between the reduced and agreed price and the item's value
            in a defective and contractual condition. In some cases, the price
            discount can be equal to the defect's significance to the buyer. If
            the defect is not insignificant and the goods have not been
            corrected or redelivered, the buyer can cancel the purchase. <br />{" "}
            <br /> If the buyer fails to fulfil their obligations under the
            agreement or the law, such as not paying for the goods, the seller
            has the right to withhold the goods, demand fulfilment of the
            agreement, terminate the agreement, and seek compensation from the
            buyer following the Consumer Purchase Act, chapter 9. Additionally,
            the seller may demand interest for late payment, debt collection
            fees, and a reasonable fee for uncollected goods, depending on the
            circumstances. The seller can demand that the buyer pays the
            purchase price and fulfil their obligations under the agreement.
            However, the seller cannot demand fulfilment if they wait an
            unreasonably long time to make the claim, or if the goods have
            already been delivered. If the buyer has a significant payment
            default or other significant default, the seller has the right to
            terminate the agreement. However, the seller cannot withdraw if the
            entire purchase price has been paid. If the seller sets a reasonable
            deadline for fulfilment and the buyer fails to pay within this
            deadline, the seller can cancel the purchase. Interest for late
            payment/debt collection fee If the buyer fails to pay the purchase
            price, the seller can claim interest on the purchase price under the
            Late Interest Act. If the buyer still doesn't pay after being
            notified, they may be held liable for fees under the Debt Collection
            Act. Fee for uncollected, non-prepaid goods If the buyer fails to
            collect unpaid goods, the seller can charge a fee that covers their
            actual outlay for delivering the goods to the buyer. However, this
            fee cannot be charged to buyers who are under the age of 18. <br />{" "}
            <br /> Guarantee: When a seller or manufacturer provides a warranty,
            it adds to the buyer's existing rights under non-derogable
            legislation. Therefore, a warranty does not limit the buyer's right
            to file a complaint or claim for delay or defects, as explained in
            sections 9 and 10. Data: <br /> <br /> Personal Information By using

            Resolution Complaints should be addressed to the seller within a
